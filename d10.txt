1.wait for user event
2.read the value of an input
3.send data to server and get back responcse (not today)
4. Manipulate the document (ex: twitter shows check mark or error depending on value of input)

We need to work with jQuery for 1,2, 4

<script> tags connect and run javascript. just like link tag connects and runs css

CSS selectors and jQuery selectors are the same. ex: changing h1 in jS $("h1").text("dogs are cute"); or $("p.cool").text(); to select one of the p tags. 

changes to the dom (which is rendered html) happen in the browsing session in real time through the javascript

text argument takes no argument or one argument. When no argument, it reads the current value. If you have an argument, it reads the argument. 

If you get a NaN error, it meants "Not a Number"

use var if you want to save something and use it later. if you want to add some text, you have to save the vars.

var originalText = $("p.cool").text()
var additionalText = "And I added some stuff."

$("p.cool")text(originalText + additionalText);

console.log your variable to see what is happening. such as counting clicks. 

if statement to have message on 2nd click appear, use if statement. for it to go back, use else statement and make the original text a var outside of that string. 

text in input tag is a VAL value


RULES: 
.text()
.val()
.on()
.css("property", "value")


you can change color ex: .css("color", "blue")
