CSS specificity
-define the CSS specificity rules and use them to target elements as desired. 

WHat is CSS Specificity?
wHhen you write a style rule, if there is an ID to a tag, the ID being that is specific will take precendent since the element selector will apply to every type.

If you have contradictory styles, the last rule will win. EX if you have text blue and then text orange for the same class, the last added class will win. 


SELECTORS - Relational

If you wnt the childre of the backed-good LI to be background color blue, instead of making classes for each li under that specific ul class. 

ul.baked-goods li {

Media query-another form of responsive layout

480 pixels wide is the standard mobile width.

@media (max-width:480px) {
hi, .nav, .article {
	width:100%
	display:block;
	}
h1, .nav {
	
	}
}

the above has to be display block or else inline block will not have stuff on top of another
