CSS positioning

When you give an element position absolute, its going to ask what relative position it should be. So if inner has 5px, and outer has nothing , the element this will be positioned against, it will use the body as a reference . You have to add "position relative" for what you waht the position absolute to relate to. 

transform: rotat (45deg); will rotate the box

add top: px or % 
and left: px of %


position: fixed; - stays on the screen and does not go anywhere. like a nav that goes as you scroll or a chatbox


REMEMBER THE SYNTAX!!!! . when using class and # for IDs!!!!!

default styling (such as hiding the div under the button click, hide it in the css by doing display:none and then add the toggle function in the js

focus will only work on buttons. for items in drop down use hover. for nav, use focus
