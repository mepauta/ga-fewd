Why do h1's have margins?
the browser has its own built in style for elements. There are css that is included in the browser. 

for the mock up:
"dew is a header 1, name is a header 2
entire page would be a div that holds 

give it 0 margin because there is no space in the mock up
both h1 and h2 have margins, set at margin 0.


*add a line break for the name!! so it separates the two**

The image is as wide as the page, and the page will be wide and will take over necessary space in page


margin:0 auto; will center everything *such as all content in the div class="container"

for the image css, if you set the height to px, it will squish the image to be sized to that pixel.
for usign width in 100%, the picture will take 100% of the image that it is, or the size of the container that it is in. 
object fit will need height and width also (hidden in css since we created a div for the pic (jeff's file)

to center and crop background image



"div.main > p" will work in css to style a child of a selector.
There is line spacing in the p within the main and to change you can use line-height: 22px;

you can overide by making exceptions. 
if a tags are width 40%, you can make email at 100% only in css. 

a tags you can give padding to make it taller. padding in css is only two sizes 10px(TB) 0 (LR)
space between all would be margin bottom. 

margin right for the twitter medium to push the others to the right

padding top and bottom for the footer. 


Check out the way I have set up the img src in the homework, we are going forward in the fashion blog folder to the img folder



NOTES FOR ME:
Margin versus width of container
