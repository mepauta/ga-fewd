ROOT-the start
absolute path- the full path
relative path-located in the same file as page
*absolute path WILL BREAK if you move file location/sub directories 


"./(folder)/(nameoffile)" its in a subdirectory of the current folder

"../" means that it is up a generation. Not a sibling file. One Parent up. 

Everything needs to be wrapped in a tag or else SEO will suffer. 


html tag <html lang="en-us">- tells what language this page is written

closing </html> html tag belongs at the bottom of the entire HTML code
<html> tag is a root element-everything else is a child

add <title> tag to add the page name</title>
<head> will contain all the style stuff. referred to as metadata
<body> will contain all of the content tags/content of the page

Formalizing the document
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en-us"
	<head>
	-<title>
	-<style>
	<body>

Style sheets-If there is a change to the style that needs to happen to all pages, a CSS file can do that, instead of going into the head of all pages individually. 

You import the CSS file via a LINK tag
<link rel="stylesheet" type="text/css" href="./style.css"

h1 {
	color:green;
}

FOR CSS Properties:
h1 would be selector (tag selector)
color is property
green is value


To change the colors for one of the selectors and not all:
EX: P tag
YOU MUST five the selector an ID.
Add the ID attribute to the P tag in the HTML sheet

<p id="first">

In CSS- 
p#first {
	color:green;
}

IDs are unique. It identifies one element. Use an ID if there is only one single element in the entire site that you need different. Other than that, there is a different style tool.

CLASS
Give it class attribute (class="highlight") in html. Very similar to ID. 
SYNTAX IS DIFFERENT in CSS. Classes can be used in numerous elements.
EX in CSS:

p.highlight {
	background-color:yellow
}
*p.highlight will only apply to paragraphs that have highlight attribute
*.highlight in css will apply to all content that has highlight attribute if its found in p tag or h1 tag
*for IDs, you dont need to add the tag in front of ID in CSS (ex: #baloney {...)


Line that goes across the page <hr>
rounded corners and shadow are CSS properties:
box-shadow
border-radius
