  <p class="first">Lorem Ipsum is unattractive, both inside and out. I fully understand why it’s former users left it for something else. They made a good decision. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. Lorem Ipsum is the single greatest threat. We are not - we are not keeping up with other websites.</p>

  <p class="second">I think the only difference between me and the other placeholder text is that I’m more honest and my words are more beautiful. Does everybody know that pig named Lorem Ipsum? She's a disgusting pig, right? An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that Lorem Ipsum's birth certificate is a fraud.</p>

  <p class="third">Look at these words. Are they small words? And he referred to my words - if they're small, something else must be small. I guarantee you there's no problem, I guarantee. I have a 10 year old son. He has words. He is so good with these words it's unbelievable. I’m the best thing that ever happened to placeholder text.</p>
