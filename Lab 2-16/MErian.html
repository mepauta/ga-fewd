<h1>All About MErian</h1>

<img src="./wine mirian.PNG">

<p> Welcome to my page! My name is Mirian and I am your average Ecuadorian-American, first generation New Yorker. You know, one of the many! Here are a bit of details about my life and other links for more information</p>

<h2> Heritage </h2>
<p>My family is from a small town located in the Andes region of Ecuador. They decided to make the move to the US back in the mid 1980s. As many immmigrants, they arrived to the country without a dime in their pocket. They worked hard for a couple of years and then I was born! Ironically, on Ecuador Independence day!</p> 
<p>Because I was the first US born person in my family (not only immediate family-overall), I did or took part of many things that are Ecuadorian such as:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Traditional Dance Groups</li>
  <li>Wearing traditional clothing on certain holidays</li>
  <li>Celebrating holidays in Ecuador and the US</li>
  <li>Eating traditional meals...</li>
</ul>
