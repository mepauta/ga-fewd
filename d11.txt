ALWAYS have your jacascript right before the closing body tag

To make the boxes bigger and not have everything in js, you can make a css rule and add another class to the css to make it bigger. Then in the JS  you van make a rule (below)
.addClass("bigger") 

then to make it smaller
$("div#one").removeClass("bigger");

api.jquery.com used to see what jquery can do. 


and next time make it smaller

toggleClass function

true false statements


parseInt(

takes a number inside the sting and returns that number as a number, instead of a string. 

If you define the var outside of the rule, then that var is a number. if it is not defined as a number, then it is a string.
