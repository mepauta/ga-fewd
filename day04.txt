When you add a second class to the class, you can just separate by a space. Classes can be mixed with IDs.

ex:<p class="green big-text"

LESSON

What is the box model?
Every tag you can conceptualize as a box.
external space is margin. 
boundary of the box is called border

In CSS (ex):
p{
	border: 24px 10px 16px 10px; 
}
top right bottom left-in replacement instead of writting padding -top, padding-right etc...

If all values are the same, you can just add 1 value
ex:
margin: 0;

Display-types
-many different types, such as block elements. inline and inline block. 
-nothing can be horizontally "next" to a block element
-default takes up 100% of the width of their parent
-div is just a box, you can put content in it. 

You can add content to the div

ex:
div{
border
margin:
}

text-align:center; to center content
Centering will be altered depending on the padding
margin-left:auto; and margin-right:auto; will center content tag
